## Build The COSMAC “ELF” A Low-Cost Experimenter’s Microcomputer

I’ve recently had a chance to start to re-read *Assembly Language Step-by-Step (2nd Edition) by Jeff Duntemann*.

In it the author links to a reproduction of a Popular Electronics article from 1976 on building your own microcomputer by Joseph Weisbecker.

Fascinating stuff about how computers actually work inside and well worth a read:

function code_example_with_javascript_syntax_highlights() {
  console.log("Showing the syntax highlighting rendering of code using gh-pages-blog.");
}
